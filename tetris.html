    <h1>BUILD THAT WALL!</h1>
    <h2>Enjoy classic Tetris from your childhood, only with a lot more bugs, and Don ofcourse.</h2>
    <p>Donald will yell stupid stuff to distract you when you score a line. <br>
        Rotation isn't possible, because it makes it harder to beat Donald (OR because I'm lazy and don't care about the
        bug that's causing it). If you want quotes faster, you can press the button at
        the bottom of the page to generate stupid quotes faster. GREAT UI, I know! I had good intentions, and motivation
        at first..
